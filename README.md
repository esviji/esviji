# esviji

## esviji is a free puzzle game where you have to fire a colored ball to destroy other balls of the same color

Some features:

- interface scaled to fit any viewport size and ratio without any visual loss
- multiple interaction options: touch, mouse and keyboard
- game persistence: close the game and resume it when you return
- full off-line support

This game came out of my mind 20 years ago thanks to the great platform that were [HP 48 calculators](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HP-48_series) (I've had 3 of them). I loved playing Puzzle Bobble, Tetris and other casual game on my HP, but was also eager to develop my own game (a sily habit I have to develop games to discover new platforms/languages), and came with this idea of a kind of mashup of Puzzle Bobble and other games.

I never found a satisfying name for this game, so I now took "esviji", a word game on "SVG", the technology used for its development.

esviji is open source, under MIT licence, feel free to <a href="https://github.com/esviji/esviji">fork it on Github</a>, make pull requests and open issues for bugs and improvement ideas.
